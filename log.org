** TODO

   + Map the path of graph properly
   + Possible issues may include time mapping to x-axis, looking into it
   + printing messages to check the values
* 01-9-15 <2015-09-01 Tue 14:48>

** TODO 
   + To add data of motion of the ball to an array
   + Use the data to plot the graph using tween
    
   

** DONE

   - Created a live upadting graph
   - attaching the same concept to our 1D motion
   - The above concept implemented with the help of a new sine curve example, added
   - The graph shows mapping of y with time, but has issues, shows line segment, need to make it a plot.

* 28-8-15 <2015-08-28 Fri 17:40>

** DONE
   - added plots
   - 1D object motion

  
** TODO

   + Plot the graph of the 1D motion with time alongside
   + need to join the plot with circles data to plot

* 26-8-15 <2015-08-26 Wed 15:03>

** DONE

   - Created structure for plotting 1D motion
   - Logistic equation graph
   - Exponential graph animation


** TODO 
*** Complete the 1D motion plot and move on to 2D motion projectiles
*** Update Colored Bars for individual bar elements
*** Examples of iterative systems
    1. Particle moving in 1-D
    2. Particle moving in 2-D
    3. Traffic Light iterating
    4. seconds clock modulo counting n
    5. Snow flake fractal
    6. sine wave
    7. compound interest graph
       - Animations using statistical data
    8. World popuation graph
    9. Cell division, exponential growth
    10. Logistic equation
    11. Projectile motion
       	- Plot v vs t, y vs x, x vs t, y vs t etc..

** Completed auto reload of diughnut chart
** Next step to add time duration text
** Now moving on to creating another visualization of traffic signal graph
   + Trying pulse graph to create a repeating band of signals
   + 
* 19-8-15  <2015-08-19 Wed 14:20>

** DONE
   + Visualization of traffic light, version one with one circle iterating red, orange, green light.
   + Visualization of a line graph, automatically forming with time.
   + Simple transitions, using d3
   + Traffic light version 2 with all three lights simultaneously going on or off,
     * The key was to select each circle seperately and applying transitions individually,
     * rather than trying to use transition simultaneously on two circles together <2015-08-19 Wed 15:54>
   + Simple Doughnut chart to vizualize traffic lights, used chart.js for the same
     <2015-08-19 Wed>
     
** TODO
   - traffic light second version, try all three lights together as a state machine
   - a line graph with real data
   - randomize time interval between trafic lights
     

* 18-8-15

** TODO
   - Learn simple transitions in d3
   - Using simple transitions, create some simple examples
   - Finish traffic light animation
   - Learn how to animate automatically with time
   - Complete traffic light animation
   - Draw a line graph with time
   - 
   

** DONE
   + Tried Traffic lights by adding redraw function with setInterval() function
   + One version of traffic light   <2015-08-18 Tue 15:30>:

<2015-08-16 Sun 23:52>
** DONE
   * First week log completed with org-mode and emacs
   * Commiting first week logs to the repository
   * Further logs to be synced with date time
