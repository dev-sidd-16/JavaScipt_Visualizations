** TODO

   - Understand and create graphs
   - check for y1, x_max first because it will be needed for graph
   - update notes

** Work from home
   - IMP Vars list
     + diag_w, diag_h, mdl_w, mdl_h, gph_w, gph_h, dash_w, dash_h
     + dataset
     + y1 : car_x_max + 20 given as diag_w/3 which should be mdl_w-(boxSize/2)
     + motion : forward(1), backward(0)
